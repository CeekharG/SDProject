In this part you will build the back end for the web application that you designed.
Remember, we are only building back end in this assignment.

Description: 
Same as described in main readme.md

Additional Details:

Back end must include following components/modules:
- Login module
- Client Profile Management module
- Fuel Quote module, includes list of quote history for a client.
- Pricing module. Only create a class. You will implement this in last assignment.

Important deliverables:
- You should have validations in place for required fields, field types, and field lengths in backend code as well. 
- All backend code should be covered by unit tests. Code coverage should be grater than 80%. 
- Research how to run the code coverage reports. Each IDE has plugins to generate reports. Here are few pointers. https://stackify.com/code-coverage-tools/
- All front end should be connected to back end. Form data should be populated from backend. Backend should receive data from front end, validate, and prepare to persist to DB.
- WE ARE NOT IMPLEMENTING DB yet. For this assignment you can hard code the values.
